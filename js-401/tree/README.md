# tree

## Feature

Features
- Node
  Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in  the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Binary Tree
  Create a Binary Tree class
  Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
  - pre order
  - in order
  - post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
  
-  Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.


- Binary Search Tree
  Create a Binary Search Tree class
  This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
  - Add
      Arguments: value
      Return: nothing
      Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
  - Contains
      Argument: value
      Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach
following the demo code, I was able to refactor so that the preorder, inorder, and postorder are methods inside the BT class. After struggling a little with the BST, Iw as able to fins some youtube videos that would help me get the result that I wanted.
