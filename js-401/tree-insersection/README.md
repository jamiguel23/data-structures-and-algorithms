# tree-intersection



## Challenge
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.


## Approach & Efficiency

My approach for this code challege was to find the preorder of both trees, assuming there there is only one instance on that value in each tree, combine them into one single string and use the find repeat string function yesterday. Got most of it working but was given the feedback that this method loses the the comparability if the trees were independent. I will turn in what I have now and work on it more at a later time.
