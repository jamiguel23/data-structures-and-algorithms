## Feature

    Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## approach

This was difficult. I had to look at outside resources to help understand more on Binary trees and the use of recursion. After getting help by the TA Alex, recursion is still a little scary but not that bad.
