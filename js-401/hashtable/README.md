# hashtable


## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

- set
Arguments: key, value
Returns: nothing
This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.
- get
Arguments: key
Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
- contains
Arguments: key
Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- keys
Returns: Collection of keys
- hash
Arguments: key
Returns: Index in the collection for that key

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
