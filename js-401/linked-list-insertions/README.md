# linked-list-insertions

## Problem Domain

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

append()
arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list.

- append was given as  a demo from coding challenge 5 and is already working 

insertBefore()
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

insertAfter()
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Approach
Much like the last lab I took time during my lunch to read and watch videos on linked list. I already had an idea on how I wanted to approach these at a glance based of previous experience from the last coding challenge. When I got stuck I was able to find tutorials on how to get unstuck.
